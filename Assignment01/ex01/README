The programme is compiled and linked by using the command "make" in the terminal.

The programme can be executed using the command: ./mgsolve l n
  
  l determines the level of recursion for the V cycle
  n determines the number of V cycles 

The programme currently runs with 2 cases
  	(a) with function g and f defined as
   		   g(x,y) = sin(PI*x)*sinh(PI*y);
		   f(x,y) = 0.0
  	(b) with function g and f defined as
		   g(0,y) = g(1,y) = du/dn = -1
		   g(x,0) = g(x,1) = x(1-x)
                   f(x,y) = 2.0
  To toggle between the two cases, please toggle the CASE within the file "main.cpp". 0 stands for case (a) and 1 stands for case (b).
